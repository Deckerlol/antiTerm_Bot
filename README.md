# Installation
Install the latest version of <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> and open a terminal inside of the antiTerm folder, run ```pip install requirements.txt``` and wait for it to install the needed libraries.

Then, fill the token.txt file with the token of your bot, most crashes are due to an invalid token. Next, checkout blacklist.txt, these are the words that the bot will delete when sent.

When you are ready to start the bot, run start.bat and wait for the bot to start, by default logging is ```On```
